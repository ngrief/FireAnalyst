## Option 2: Local Installation

### Windows

3. Run:

pdflatex findings_report.tex
pdflatex findings_report.tex  # Run twice for references
```

## Option 3: Convert to Markdown (For LinkedIn Post)

If you just want to share on LinkedIn without PDF:

1. The LaTeX contains all the content
2. Copy sections directly to LinkedIn as text
3. Use LinkedIn formatting (bold, italics, bullets)
4. Add the GitHub link

**Key sections to include:**
- Executive Summary
- The Scale of the Problem
- What the Data Reveals (temporal, seasonal, causes)
- The Containment Effectiveness Problem
- The Path Forward
- Link to GitHub repo

## Files Created

- `findings_report.tex` - Main findings document (LinkedIn-ready)
- `methodology.tex` - Full technical methodology (academic)

Both are publication-quality LaTeX documents ready for compilation.

## Troubleshooting

**"Package not found" errors:**
- MiKTeX/MacTeX will auto-install missing packages on first compile
- Click "Install" when prompted
- May need to run pdflatex 2-3 times for all references to resolve

**Compilation takes forever:**
- First compile is slow (installs packages)
- Subsequent compiles are fast

**Still having issues:**
- Use Overleaf (online, always works)
- Or share the `.tex` file directly - many professionals can compile it
